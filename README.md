## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- next`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app. It serves as an example frontend.
- `server`: a sample express server, serves as an example API endpoint.
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `next-app`
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
