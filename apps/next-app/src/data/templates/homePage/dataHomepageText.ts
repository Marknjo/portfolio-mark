  I'am a self-taught software engineer focused on web applications. 
  
  I use all my energy tinkering with JavaScript and it's ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

  I have a lot to share with you

  Let me walk you through my world.

  My Short Story

  Hey, as I noted earlier, I am all JavaScript.

  I've played with programming languages like Python, C#, GO, & PHP, but I could not resist JavaScript's charms. Nevertheless, I've learned a lot by experimenting with them.

  By profession, I'm a graduate of Operations Management. That means I have what it takes to make any business a success.

  However, over time, I felt my mind belonged somewhere else. In my early days as a Business student, I was fond of sneaking into computer science lectures. Along the way, I picked HTML, CSS, UI/UX design, and eventually, when the time was right, I leaped. Since 2019, I have been all hands on deck. 

  And that's why you are now looking at my dev portfolio. So far, I feel proud I switched my career.

  Did you think I made the right decision?

  I would love to hear your thoughts.

  Hey, This project is actually this template.

  It is supposed to be catchy, modern, expressive, and packed with a lot of concepts on UI/UX and Front-end design principles.

  With this project I want to express my love for design. Handcraft every piece of it to give it my personality.

  I hope by looking at it and exploring it, you will get in love with how I approach software engineering. In this case, front-end design.

  Do you want to dive deep?
