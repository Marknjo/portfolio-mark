  I'am a self-taught software engineer focused on web applications. 
  
  I use all my energy tinkering with JavaScript and it's ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

  I have a lot to share with you

  Let me walk you through my world.

  My Short Story
  Hey, as I noted earlier, I am all JavaScript

  But once upon a time, I tried my luck with PHP, Did not find it all-round like JavaScript. That's in the past, Though.

  Like I don't code in PHP anymore, I am an Operations Manager by paper. That means I have a background in business management.

  Overtime, I found my professional a little lackluster and financial undependable. I wanted to switch to a high value skill field. A field I cannot retire from, it pays the bills, and I still find it fun no matter how head-aching it is. So, since 2021, I have been all hands on deck.

  And that's why you are now looking at my dev portfolio. Did you think I made the right decision?

  HI would love to hear your thoughts.

  Hey, This project is actually this template.

  It is supposed to be catchy, modern, expressive, and packed with a lot of concepts on UI/UX and Front-end design principles.

  With this project I want to express my love for design. Handcraft every piece of it to give it my personality.

  I hope by looking at it and exploring it, you will get in love with how I approach software engineering. In this case, front-end design.

  Do you want to dive deep?
